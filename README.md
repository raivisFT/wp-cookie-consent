What is GDPR?
-------------
GDPR, or the General Data Protection Regulation is a comprehensive data protection law in the EU aimed at safeguarding EU individuals’ privacy and regulating how organizations handle their personal data. It is also known as DatenSchutz-Grundverordnung or DSGVO in German.

GDPR requires websites to obtain explicit consent from users before storing or accessing cookies on their devices. This is known as GDPR cookie consent.

GDPR mandates cookie consent because cookies allow websites to collect data and track users across multiple sessions. Since this impacts user privacy, consent is required before enabling cookies, especially non-essential cookies like analytics, advertisements, etc.

What is CCPA?
-------------
CCPA is the California Consumer Privacy Act, a law granting California residents more control over their personal information held by businesses. Businesses must be transparent, offer opt-out options, and ensure data security.

CCPA Compliance refers to adherence to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), a law designed to protect the privacy rights of California residents. It mandates that businesses handling the personal information of California residents provide certain rights and protections to those individuals. Compliance involves ensuring that businesses meet the CCPA’s requirements regarding data collection and processing.
